# 🔷 C# Polymorphism Concept Project

Welcome to this C# project focused on one of the core pillars of object-oriented programming: **Polymorphism**. This repository demonstrates how polymorphic behavior allows different object types to be treated uniformly through interfaces and inheritance.

## 📘 Project Description

In this implementation:
- We define a base class and an interface to show how derived classes can override or extend base functionalities.
- The project showcases how to work with a shared interface (`IQuittable`) and use polymorphism in practical scenarios such as handling employee actions.
- Emphasis is placed on clean code architecture and understanding runtime behavior through type casting and method overriding.

## 🔑 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Inheritance**: Building a hierarchy of classes with shared and extended behavior.
- **Interfaces**: Establishing a contract for behavior that different classes can implement in their own way.
- **Polymorphism**: Using base class or interface references to operate on derived class objects.

## 📂 Repository

- 🔗 **Live Repository**: [Polymorphism Assignment Submission](https://github.com/DileverSarii/Polymorphism-Assignment-Submission)

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DileverSarii/Polymorphism-Assignment-Submission.git
   ```
2. Open the `.sln` file with **Visual Studio**.
3. Build and run the solution (`Ctrl + F5`).
4. Observe the output in the console and how polymorphism is executed in runtime.

## 👨‍💻 Learning Outcome

This project is perfect for anyone looking to:
- Understand the power of polymorphism in object-oriented programming.
- Learn how interfaces improve flexibility and code organization.
- Practice writing reusable and scalable C# code.
